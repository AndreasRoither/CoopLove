# CoopLove

CoopLove revolves around a simple concept. Two players have to reach the goal while they are coloring platforms. Once a platform has the color of a player, the other player cannot use that platform anymore. Several additions like reset buttons and timed platforms paired together with great level design can make this game quite fun :)
